##What is Mosaic?
Mosaic converts images to LEGO mosaics that can be opened with LEGO Digital Designer.

###How does it work?
  1. The image is processed pixel by pixel
  2. Colors are reduced to the LEGO color palette
  3. Each pixel becomes a 1x1 brick
  4. Bricks are written to .lxf file

###How to run mosaic
  1. Download the program files
  2. Download Python 3.5 for your operating system
  3. Install Tkinter and Pillow packages with PIP
  4. Run main.py with Python 3.5

###How to use mosaic
  1. Run main.py with Python 3.5
  2. Select a .jpg or .png image
  3. Select a destination to save your .lxf mosaic
  4. Open .lxf with LEGO Digital Designer 4.3
